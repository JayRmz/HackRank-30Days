# 30 Days of Code
This is a day-by-day challenge from Hacker Rank.

I'm going to try solving every single challenge in Swift 5 with CLT for MacOS

## Day 0 

### Objective 
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

## Day 1
### Objective
Today, we're discussing data types. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
    * Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
    * Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    * Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
