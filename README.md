# 30 Days of Code
This is a day-by-day challenge from Hacker Rank.

I'm going to try solving every single challenge in Swift 5 with CLT for MacOS


## Day 0 - Hello, World.

### Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.


## Day 1 - Data Types

### Task
Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
    * Print the sum of  plus your int variable on a new line.
    * Print the sum of  plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    * Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.


## Day 2 - Operators

### Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.


## Day 3 - Intro to Conditional Statements

### Task
Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.


## Day 4 - Class vs. Instance

### Task
Write a Person class with an instance variable, , and a constructor that takes an integer, , as a parameter. The constructor must assign  to  after confirming the argument passed as  is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as , the constructor should set  to  and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the  instance variable by .
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If , print You are young..
If  and , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
To help you learn by example and complete this challenge, much of the code is provided for you, but you'll be writing everything in the future. The code that creates each instance of your Person class is in the main method. Don't worry if you don't understand it all quite yet!


## Day 5 - Loops

### Task
Given an integer, n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n x i (where 1 <= i <= 10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.
